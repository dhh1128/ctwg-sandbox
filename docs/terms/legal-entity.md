A **Legal Entity** is an %%entity|entity%% that is known by and recognized to exist in a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%. For %%legal jurisdictions|legal-jurisdiction%%, this usually means that the entity is registered. Legal jurisdictions usually have a registration for its citizens, foreigners, enterprises, fellonies, etc. Non-legal jurisdictions (e.g. a soccer club) register their members, donators, staff, properties, etc., either on the record, or off the record.



The %%Jurisdictions pattern|pattern-jurisdiction%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

It is important to recognize that the term 'legal entity' does not refer to something that has an existence of its own, but that it is a property of en %%entity|entity%% that is linked to a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%.

### Examples

<!--Provide a few sentences in which you give examples that obviously qualify as instances of `<New Term>`, and that do NOT obviously qualify. Also, provide examples that are not (so) obvious, but help users to better understand its intension.-->

- citizens (organizations, etc.) that are registered in the citizens registration of some government, are legal entities in its jurisdiction.

- a refugee that is screaming before a civil servant person (i.e. (s)he is alive and kicking, and really exists), yet is not registered in the governmental administration, does not exist for that administration, i.e. is not a legal entity in that jurisdiction.

- whether or not some special stone qualifies as legal entity depends on whether or not it is known to exist in some jurisdiction.
