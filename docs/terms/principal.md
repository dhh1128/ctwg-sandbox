### Short Description

A **principal** is the term we use to refer to the party for which (on whose behalf) an %%agent|agent%% is executing an %%action|action%%. The Agent-Principal relation is an %%actor|actor%%-party relation where the %%actor|actor%% is executing an %%action|action%% on behalf of that party, and for the execution of which that party has established a %%policy|policy%% that the %%agent|agent%% must (or may) follow, and hence must have access to). For %%digital agents|digital-agent%%, 



The %%Parties, Actors and Actions pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.



### Purpose

The ability to distinguish between (non)principals is relevant in many situations, including:

- electronic communication: the principal 



### Criterion

The **principal** (of an %%actor|actor%%) is the party for whom the actor is an %%agent|agent%%, i.e. on whose behalf the actor is (in the process of) executing some %%action|action%%.



### Examples



- A person that is 'doing its own things' is the Principal for himself (as an Actor); the person is also an Agent for himself (as a party).

- When a person is doing things for his employer, the latter is his Principal.
