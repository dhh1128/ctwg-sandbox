### Short Description
A **Trustworthy Credential** (of an %%SSI Assurance Community|ssi-ac%%)’ is a %%verifiable credential|verifiable-credential%%,
- whose %%type|credential-type%% is specified by (and published in the %%Credential Catalogue|credential-catalogue%% of) that %%SSI-AC|ssi-ac%%;
- of which the ‘envelope’ (metadata) includes one or more %%accreditation credential|accreditation-credential%% payloads, one of which is issued by, or on behalf of that  %%SSI-AC|ssi-ac%%, and is of a type that is specified (and published) by that %%SSI-AC|ssi-ac%%.

The fact that such credentials contain an %%accreditation credential|accreditation-credential%% of the SSI-AC means that it comes with the particular assurances as stated in the associated accreditation scheme. The credential is ‘trustworthy’ for any %%party|party%% that appreciates the assurances provided by that accreditation scheme.

### Purpose
The purpose of **Trustworthy Credentials** is to allow parties in the different roles of issuer, holder and verifier to obtain assurances about their handling of credentials of specific kinds.

### Criteria
A **Trustworthy Credential** (of an %%SSI Assurance Community|ssi-ac%%)’ is a %%verifiable credential|verifiable-credential%%,
- whose %%type|credential-type%% is specified by (and published in the %%Credential Catalogue|credential-catalogue%% of) that %%SSI-AC|ssi-ac%%;
- of which the ‘envelope’ (metadata) includes one or more %%accreditation credential|accreditation-credential%% payloads, one of which is issued by, or on behalf of that  %%SSI-AC|ssi-ac%%, and is of a type that is specified (and published) by that %%SSI-AC|ssi-ac%%.

### Examples
Here is an example of a 'Trustworthy Credential' as it might have been issued by ACME to a person called Wayne Dodge. It states that Wayne has been tested on April 30th, 2020, and that the result of the test was negative %%party|party%% . It also contains ACME’s trustworthy credential that allows a verifier to obtain assurance that, according to %%SSI Assurance Community|ssi-ac%% DHAC, ACME is a trusted issuer for this credential.
