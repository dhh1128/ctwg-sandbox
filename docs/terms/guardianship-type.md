### Short Description

A **Guardianship-type** is a class of %%guardianship relationships|guardianship%% within the %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% that has defined it. It comprises %%duty and right types|pattern-duties-and-rights%% that can be used as a template for instantiating %%duties and rights|pattern-duties-and-rights%% of %%guardianship relationships|guardianship%% that instantiate the %%guardianship-type|guardianship-type%%.



A good way to think abouat a %%guardianship-type|guardianship-type%% is to see it as a template from which instances - i.e. actual %%guardianship relationships|guardianship%% can be derived.



The %%Guardianship pattern|pattern-guardianship%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.



### Purpose

A **Guardianship-type** serves as a template from which instances - i.e. actual %%guardianship relationships|guardianship%% can be derived. It allows the %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% within which it is defined to specify generic %%duties and rights|pattern-duties-and-rights%%, both for the %%guardian|guardian%% and the %%dependent|dependent%% in (instantiated) %%guardianship relationships|guardianship%%, without knowing which %%entities|entity%% will be(come) the %%guardian|guardian%% or the %%dependent|dependent%%.



### Criteria

An **guardianship-type** is a class of %%guardianship-relationships|guardianship%% that comprises a (non-empty) set of %%duty/right types|pattern-duties-and-rights%% for at least the %%guardian|guardian%% and/or the %%dependent|dependent%% (and perhaps other roles), the semantics of which are defined by the %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%.
