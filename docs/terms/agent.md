### Short Description

An **Agent** is an %%actor|actor%% that is executing an action %%action|action%% on behalf of some party (which we call the %%principal|principal%% of that agent). During the time interval in which the action is executed, the actor may execute other actions in other execution-contexts, on behalf of the same or another party. However, for the execution of a single %%action|action%%, the actor is an agent for precisely one principal. It is assumed that the principal provides its agents with the %%policies|policy%% that provide the agents with the rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance that they need to comply with when exeucting the action.



The %%Parties, Actors and Actions pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.



### Purpose

The ability to distinguish between (non)agents is relevant in many situations, including:

- electronic communication: the agent 



### Criterion

An **Agent** is a role that an %%actor|actor%% fulfills with respect to some party when that actor is executing some %%action|action%% on behalf of that party.



### Examples

- An ambassador, when (s)he is 'in function', acts as an Agent for the country for which (s)he is ambassador.
